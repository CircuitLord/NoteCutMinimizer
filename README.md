# NoteCutMinimizer
A mod that lets you bring back the coolness of having note debris on in Beat Saber, without blocking your vision like it does normally.
Also makes debris fly in the direction of the cut. (to some extent)

NCM enhances your experience using many methods:
1. Making it so the note debris always fall in a downwards-ish direction, keeping them from popping up in front of you and blocking your vision.

2. The note debris will slice in the direction you cut, instead of it being random, which helps keep notes out of your main vision.

3. Notes debris that are higher up on the grid are given a shorter lifetime, so that they don't block your vision when you cut them.
